        <h1 class="text-primary">What is the DOM?</h1>
        <p>The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for web documents. It provides a way for programs
            to interact with the content, structure, and style of an HTML or XML document.</p>
        <h2>What is the purpose of the DOM?</h2>
        <p>The purpose of the DOM is to provide a standardized way for programs to access and manipulate the content of
            web pages. This allows web developers to write code that can dynamically update the content of a web page
            based on user interactions or other events, without having to reload the entire page.</p>
        <h2>Common use cases for the DOM</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Adding, removing, or modifying HTML elements on a web page</li>
            <li>Modifying the styles or layout of HTML elements</li>
            <li>Responding to user input, such as clicks or keyboard events</li>
            <li>Dynamically fetching or updating content from a server without reloading the entire page</li>
        </ul>
        <h1 class="text-primary">How will you select HTML elements using DOM?</h1>
        <p>One of the key features of the DOM is its ability to select and manipulate HTML elements on a web page. There
            are several methods available for selecting elements, each with its own strengths and weaknesses.</p>
        <h2>DOM methods for selecting elements</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>getElementById:</strong> Returns the element with the specified ID attribute.</li>
            <li><strong>getElementsByClassName:</strong> Returns a collection of elements with the specified class name.
            </li>
            <li><strong>getElementsByTagName:</strong> Returns a collection of elements with the specified tag name.
            </li>
            <li><strong>querySelector:</strong> Returns the first element that matches the specified CSS selector.</li>
            <li><strong>querySelectorAll:</strong> Returns a list of all elements that match the specified CSS selector.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>These methods can be called on the document object, which represents the entire HTML document, or on
            individual HTML elements themselves. Once an element has been selected, it can be manipulated using various
            DOM methods, such as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>innerHTML:</strong> Gets or sets the HTML content of an element.</li>
            <li><strong>setAttribute:</strong> Sets the value of the specified attribute on an element.</li>
            <li><strong>appendChild:</strong> Adds a new child node to an element.</li>
            <li><strong>removeChild:</strong> Removes a child node from an element.</li>
            <li><strong>addEventListener:</strong> Attaches an event listener to an element.</li>
        </ul>
        <h1 class="text-primary">What is event bubbling?</h1>
        <p>Event bubbling is a feature of the DOM that allows events to "bubble up" from child elements to their parent
            elements, and potentially even to higher-level ancestors in the document hierarchy.</p>
        <h2>How does event bubbling work?</h2>
        <p>When an event is triggered on an element, such as a click or a keypress, the event will be handled by that
            element first. If the event has not been fully handled by the element, it will then "bubble up" to the
            element's parent, and so on up the document hierarchy until it reaches the top-level document object. Along
            the way, each element in the hierarchy can handle the event or choose to pass it along to the next level.
        </p>
        <h2>Why is event bubbling important?</h2>
        <p>Event bubbling is important because it allows for more flexible event handling on a web page. Instead of
            having to attach an event listener to every individual element on a page, you can attach a single event
            listener to a parent element and handle events as they bubble up. This can be particularly useful for
            dynamic web pages where elements may be added or removed dynamically, since you don't need to update event
            listeners for each individual element.</p>
        <h1 class="text-primary">What is a callback function and why will you use it?</h1>
        <p>A callback function is a function that is passed as an argument to another function and is executed by that
            function at a later time. The purpose of a callback function is to allow the calling function to continue
            executing while the callback function performs some asynchronous or time-consuming operation, and then
            receive a notification when the operation is complete.</p>
